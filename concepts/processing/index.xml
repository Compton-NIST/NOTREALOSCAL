This process of applying a profile to a catalog to create a new catalog is called Profile Resolution. Not all OSCAL Profiles will be resolved, nor are expected to be; however, the resolution requirements in this document are crucial to understanding the intended functionality of any given OSCAL Profile. This specification is intended for software developers who intend to develop an OSCAL Profile Resolver, or for OSCAL Profile authors who want a more in-depth understanding of profile resolution.</description></item></channel></rss>
